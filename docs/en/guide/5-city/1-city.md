# A Record of Jingu's Elegance: Tianjin, the Pearl of the Bohai Sea Blending Ancient and Modern

Tianjin City, abbreviated as "Jin" and also known as Jingu or Jinmen, is a municipality directly under the Central Government of the People's Republic of China, a national central city, and a megacity. It is located in North China, the lower reaches of the Haihe River Basin, bordering the Bohai Sea to the east, backed by the Yanshan Mountains to the north, adjacent to Beijing (the national capital) to the west, and surrounded by Hebei Province on other sides. As of October 2023, Tianjin administers 16 districts, covering a total area of 11,966.45 square kilometers. By the end of 2023, Tianjin had a permanent population of 13.64 million, with an urbanization rate of 85.49%.

Tianjin is among the first batch of coastal open cities and the first batch of international consumption center cities in China. It is also a national historical and cultural city, a national advanced manufacturing R&D base, a core area for northern international shipping, a demonstration zone for financial innovation and operation, and a pioneer zone for reform and opening-up. Additionally, it serves as a major node of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor, a strategic pivot of the Maritime Silk Road, an intersection of the "Belt and Road" Initiative, and the closest eastern starting point of the Eurasian Land Bridge. As a crucial hub connecting domestic and international regions, linking the north and the south, and communicating the east and the west, Tianjin is an important seaport for neighboring inland countries and the largest port city in northern China.

Surrounding Tianjin are several tourist cities with distinctive features, including Beijing, Qingdao, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, Weihai, Shenyang, and Zibo.
